/* 
  * This problem is not straightforward to solve in Dafny because it involves string manipulation and sorting, 
  * which is not natively supported in Dafny. However, a pseudo-code for this problem would look like this:
  * 
  * 1. Convert all integers in the array to strings
  * 2. Sort the array of strings in descending order using a custom comparator that compares two strings s1 and s2 by comparing s1+s2 and s2+s1
  * 3. Concatenate all strings in the array to form the largest number
  * 
  * In a language like Python, the code would look like this:
  * 
  * def largestNumber(nums):
  *     if not nums: return "0"
  *     nums = [str(num) for num in nums]
  *     nums.sort(cmp=lambda x, y: cmp(y+x, x+y))
  *     return ''.join(nums).lstrip('0') or '0'
  * 
  * Unfortunately, this code cannot be directly translated to Dafny due to Dafny's limitations.
